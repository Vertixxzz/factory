The provided code implements two classic design patterns - Factory Method and Abstract Fatcory - in a compact and educational manner

The code is easy to read thanks to self-explanatory class and method names such as Notifier, NotificationChannel, DbFactory, DbConnection
Each class has a clear, single responsibility, and the demonstration methods (demoFactoryMethod, demoAbstractFactory) show how the patterns work in practice

The Factory Method pattern is represented through the abstract creator Notifier, which defines the factory method createChanne
Concrete creators (EmailNotifier, SmsNotifier) specify which product (EmailChannel or SmsChannel) is instantiated
The Abstract Factory pattern is shown through the DbFactory interface, which produces families of related objects (DbConnection and DbCommand)
Concrete factories (PgFactory, MyFactory) return consistent sets of products, and the client DatabaseApp uses only abstractions, remaining decoupled from specific implementations

The code contains all key elements of both patterns: abstract definitions, concrete implementations, client code, and demo executions
It successfully illustrates how Factory Method handles variations of a single product, while Abstract Factory manages multiple related products as a family
Though simplified, the implementation fully conveys the intent of each pattern and provides a strong basis for extension

Overall, the code is clear, structurally sound, and complete for a teaching example
It effectively demontrates the differences and use cases of Factory Method and Abstract Factory, making it suitable for both learning and quick reference
